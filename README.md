# Battleship-Game
The computer based version of the Battleship Game. Classic rules apply!

The Host files contain the main logic and brains behind the game. The Host is in
charge of enforcing the rules and displaying relevant output to both players like
shot data and wins/losses data.

The player files contain the logic for how a player will behave. The player files
contain information on how the player will choose his/her's shot and reactions to
other players' shots. Feel free to look at my player file as a template and create your
own player to see if you can beat others. Enjoy!
